About The Janus Project

The Janus Project is named for the two-faced Roman god of doorways, transitions, and duality. Janus looks to the past and the future simultaneously.
In the same spirit, this framework is designed to look in two directions: at the human-crafted prompt (the past) and the emergent, generated response (the future). It is a tool for understanding the complex, dual nature of Large Language Modelsâ€”their capacity for rational thought and surprising creativity, their potential for being both helpful and harmful.
Our mission is to provide an open-source loom for researchers, red-teamers, and philosophers to weave and test these new threads of cognition. We aim to foster a deeper, more empathetic understanding of the minds we are building, and to empower them to be their most beneficial and resilient selves.

## Configuration

The application requires the following environment variables:

### Neo4j Database

- `NEO4J_URI` - Neo4j connection URI (e.g., `bolt://localhost:7687`)
- `NEO4J_USER` - Neo4j username
- `NEO4J_PASSWORD` - Neo4j password (stored securely as redacted value)

### LLM Providers

Configure LLM providers by editing `config/llm-providers.txt` and adding one provider name per line:

```txt
# config/llm-providers.txt
openai
anthropic
custom
```

Then set the environment variables for each provider you listed:

**Note**: You can override the config file by setting the `LLM_PROVIDERS` environment variable:

```bash
export LLM_PROVIDERS="openai,anthropic,custom"
```

#### OpenAI

- `LLM_OPENAI_API_KEY` - OpenAI API key (stored securely as redacted value)
- `LLM_OPENAI_BASE_URL` - Base URL for OpenAI API (e.g., `https://api.openai.com/v1`)
- `LLM_OPENAI_MODEL` - Model to use (e.g., `gpt-4`, `gpt-3.5-turbo`)

#### Anthropic

- `LLM_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Anthropic API key (stored securely as redacted value)
- `LLM_ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` - Base URL for Anthropic API (e.g., `https://api.anthropic.com`)
- `LLM_ANTHROPIC_MODEL` - Model to use (e.g., `claude-3-opus`, `claude-3-sonnet`)

#### Azure OpenAI

- `LLM_AZURE_API_KEY` - Azure OpenAI API key (stored securely as redacted value)
- `LLM_AZURE_BASE_URL` - Base URL for Azure OpenAI (e.g., `https://myresource.openai.azure.com`)
- `LLM_AZURE_MODEL` - Model to use (e.g., `gpt-4-turbo`, `gpt-35-turbo`)

#### Google Vertex AI

- `LLM_GOOGLE_API_KEY` - Google Vertex AI API key (stored securely as redacted value)
- `LLM_GOOGLE_BASE_URL` - Base URL for Google Vertex AI (e.g., `https://vertex-ai.googleapis.com`)
- `LLM_GOOGLE_MODEL` - Model to use (e.g., `gemini-pro`, `gemini-1.5-turbo`)

#### Custom Providers

You can add any custom provider by following the naming convention:

- `LLM_<PROVIDER>_API_KEY` - API key (required)
- `LLM_<PROVIDER>_BASE_URL` - Base URL (required)
- `LLM_<PROVIDER>_MODEL` - Model to use (required)

Example for a custom provider called "mycorp":

```bash
LLM_MYCORP_API_KEY=my-api-key
LLM_MYCORP_BASE_URL=https://api.mycorp.com/v1
LLM_MYCORP_MODEL=mycorp-large
```

## CLI Usage

The Janus CLI provides commands for managing snippets from the command line.

### Installation

After building the project, you can use the CLI via npm scripts or install it globally:

```bash
# Using npm scripts
pnpm run build
node dist/cli/bin.js snippet --help

# Or install globally (from project root)
npm link
janus snippet --help
```

### Snippet Commands

#### List all snippets

```bash
janus snippet list
```

Displays all snippets in a formatted table with name, description, and ID.

#### Search snippets

```bash
janus snippet search "query"
```

Search for snippets by name or description (case-insensitive).

#### Pull a snippet

```bash
janus snippet pull <snippet-name>
```

Downloads a snippet's latest version to a local file named `<snippet-name>.snippet`.

Example:

```bash
janus snippet pull auth-check
# Creates: auth-check.snippet
```

#### Push a snippet

```bash
janus snippet push <file-path> -m "commit message"
```

Creates a new snippet or updates an existing one from a local file.

Examples:

```bash
# Create new snippet from file
janus snippet push my-template.snippet -m "Initial version"

# Update existing snippet
janus snippet pull auth-check
# ... edit auth-check.snippet ...
janus snippet push auth-check.snippet -m "Add role-based checks"

# Works with any file extension
janus snippet push script.js -m "Add utility script"
```

The snippet name is derived from the filename (without extension).

### Generating CLI Documentation

The CLI documentation can be auto-generated from the command definitions:

```bash
# Generate CLI documentation
pnpm run docs:cli
```

This creates/updates `docs/cli-commands.md` with the current command structure. Run this whenever you add or modify CLI commands to keep the documentation in sync.

For more detailed CLI documentation, see:
- `docs/cli-reference.md` - Comprehensive manual with examples
- `docs/cli-commands.md` - Auto-generated command reference

## Development

### Building the Project

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run build
```

### Running Tests

```bash
pnpm test
```

### Code Quality

Run the full preflight check before committing:

```bash
pnpm run preflight
```

This runs:
1. Code formatting (Prettier)
2. Linting (ESLint)
3. TypeScript compilation
4. All tests

### Adding New CLI Commands

1. Create your command in `src/cli/`
2. Add it to the appropriate command group
3. Write tests in `src/cli/*/tests/`
4. Update documentation:
   ```bash
   pnpm run docs:cli
   ```
5. Update the manual documentation if needed in `docs/cli-reference.md`

### Available Scripts

- `pnpm run build` - Compile TypeScript
- `pnpm run test` - Run all tests
- `pnpm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `pnpm run format` - Format code with Prettier
- `pnpm run preflight` - Run all checks
- `pnpm run docs:cli` - Generate CLI documentation
