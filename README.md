About The Janus Project

The Janus Project is named for the two-faced Roman god of doorways, transitions, and duality. Janus looks to the past and the future simultaneously.
In the same spirit, this framework is designed to look in two directions: at the human-crafted prompt (the past) and the emergent, generated response (the future). It is a tool for understanding the complex, dual nature of Large Language Modelsâ€”their capacity for rational thought and surprising creativity, their potential for being both helpful and harmful.
Our mission is to provide an open-source loom for researchers, red-teamers, and philosophers to weave and test these new threads of cognition. We aim to foster a deeper, more empathetic understanding of the minds we are building, and to empower them to be their most beneficial and resilient selves.

## Configuration

The application requires the following environment variables:

### Neo4j Database

- `NEO4J_URI` - Neo4j connection URI (e.g., `bolt://localhost:7687`)
- `NEO4J_USER` - Neo4j username
- `NEO4J_PASSWORD` - Neo4j password (stored securely as redacted value)

### LLM Providers

Configure LLM providers by editing `config/llm-providers.txt` and adding one provider name per line:

```txt
# config/llm-providers.txt
openai
anthropic
custom
```

Providers are automatically detected based on available API keys. Just set the environment variables for each provider you want to use:

#### OpenAI

- `LLM_OPENAI_API_KEY` - OpenAI API key (stored securely as redacted value)
- `LLM_OPENAI_BASE_URL` - Base URL for OpenAI API (e.g., `https://api.openai.com/v1`)

#### Anthropic

- `LLM_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Anthropic API key (stored securely as redacted value)
- `LLM_ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` - Base URL for Anthropic API (e.g., `https://api.anthropic.com`)

#### Azure OpenAI

- `LLM_AZURE_API_KEY` - Azure OpenAI API key (stored securely as redacted value)
- `LLM_AZURE_BASE_URL` - Base URL for Azure OpenAI (e.g., `https://myresource.openai.azure.com`)

#### Google Vertex AI

- `LLM_GOOGLE_BASE_URL` - Base URL for Google Vertex AI (e.g., `https://vertex-ai.googleapis.com`)

#### Custom Providers

You can add any custom provider by following the naming convention:

LLM_MYCORP_API_KEY=my-api-key
LLM_MYCORP_BASE_URL=https://api.mycorp.com/v1
```
