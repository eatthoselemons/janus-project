About The Janus Project

The Janus Project is named for the two-faced Roman god of doorways, transitions, and duality. Janus looks to the past and the future simultaneously.
In the same spirit, this framework is designed to look in two directions: at the human-crafted prompt (the past) and the emergent, generated response (the future). It is a tool for understanding the complex, dual nature of Large Language Modelsâ€”their capacity for rational thought and surprising creativity, their potential for being both helpful and harmful.
Our mission is to provide an open-source loom for researchers, red-teamers, and philosophers to weave and test these new threads of cognition. We aim to foster a deeper, more empathetic understanding of the minds we are building, and to empower them to be their most beneficial and resilient selves.
