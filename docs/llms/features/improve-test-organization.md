## FEATURE:

There are 2 things to do:

1. expand tests, need test cases on an expected case, a failure case, and an edge case
2. Re-organize the files. Many of the files, especially the models, need to be broken up into smaller files

I expect that there will need to be a set of test directories with sub-files for each model type
Also there should be many tests for neo4j, testing that the database operations work, testing that the various queries to the database do create/update/delete the data they are supposed to

## EXAMPLES:

there are a few tests in the `src/core/model.tests.ts`

## DOCUMENTATION:

There is an "effect-compliance-checklist.md" in `docs/llms/effect/` made from the effect documentation that has a lot of tasks we need for implementing effect correctly

There is also the effect llm documentation, follow any links you need for more information

- **Topics/Index:** `https://effect.website/llms.txt`

You can find the entire vitest documentation in `examples/vitest/docs`

You can also find the entire neo4j documentation at `examples/neo4j-documentation`

You can find effect specific test instructions here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@effect/vitest

follow the best practices as laid out in the `docs/llms/examples/effect-normand-paradigm-guide.md` and `docs/llms/examples/effect-compostion-guide.m`

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

include tests to ensure that the `Schema.Structs` are have been implemented correctly, there are `Model.Class` features that are commonly used for database queries but `Model.Class` is intended for sql not neo4j so we need to make many of the features ourself via `Schema.Struct` refer to the documentation in `
