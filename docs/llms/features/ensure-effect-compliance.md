## FEATURE:

We need to ensure that the code written so far complies with effect best practices as well as the style outlined in "grokking simplicity" by Eric Normand

## EXAMPLES:

There is documentation with examples in the `docs/llms/examples/` directory. There are three files that have examples compiled from example effect projects

- effect-composition-guide.md: gives examples of how to do composition in effect
- effect-normand-paradigm-guide.md: gives examples of how to ensure code is following functional principles
- llm-normand-composition-guide.md: is a summary of the other two documents

## DOCUMENTATION:

There is an "effect-compliance-checklist.md" in `docs/llms/effect/` made from the effect documentation that has a lot of tasks we need for implementing effect correctly

There is also the effect llm documentation

- **Condensed:** `https://effect.website/llms-small.txt`
- **Full:** `https://effect.website/llms-full.txt`
- **Topics/Index:** `https://effect.website/llms.txt`
