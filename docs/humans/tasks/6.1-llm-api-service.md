# Task: LLM API Service Implementation

## Overview
Implement an `LlmApi` service that abstracts LLM provider interactions, enabling the Janus project to call different LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.) through a unified interface using the `@effect/ai` package.

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

## Summary for PR

### What
Implemented a unified LLM API service that provides a single interface for interacting with multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) using the @effect/ai packages.

### Key Features
- **Unified Interface**: Single `generate` method that works with any supported LLM provider
- **Auto-Detection**: Automatically detects available providers based on API keys (no manual configuration needed)
- **Proper System Message Handling**: Extracts and passes system messages correctly to each provider
- **Type-Safe Implementation**: Uses Effect-TS patterns with branded types and Match syntax
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, and multi-provider test coverage

### Technical Highlights
- Provider detection based on model name prefixes (gpt*, claude*, gemini*)
- Automatic provider configuration from environment variables
- Effect layers for dependency injection
- Scoped resource management for HTTP clients
- Error wrapping with provider-specific context

### Testing
- 7 unit tests covering all functionality
- 10 integration tests including:
  - Basic generation for each provider
  - Multi-turn conversations
  - System message handling
  - Error scenarios
- All tests passing (325 total tests in codebase)

  - Tests for Google API
  - **Multi-turn conversation tests for each provider** (improved)
  - **System message tests for each provider** (added)
  - Error handling test
  - All tests skip unless `INTEGRATION_TEST=true`
  - Increased timeout to 60s for API calls

### 8. Created Export Files (✅ completed)
- `src/services/llm-api/index.ts` - Exports service definition
- `src/layers/llm-api/index.ts` - Exports layers

## Technical Details

### Provider Detection Logic
- `gpt*` models → OpenAI
- `claude*` models → Anthropic
- `gemini*` models → Google
- Unknown models → Error

### Conversation Handling
- Converts internal `Conversation` type to AI package format
- Supports system, user, and assistant messages
- System messages are prefixed with `[System]` in user messages

### Error Handling
- All errors wrapped in `LlmApiError`
- Includes provider name, status code, and original message
- Proper error propagation through Effect chain

## Testing Results
- ✅ All unit tests passing (7/7)
- ✅ Integration tests ready (skipped by default)
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ ESLint passing (no errors in new code)
- ✅ Effect compliance verified

## Integration Points
- Uses `ConfigService` for provider configuration
- Integrates with `@effect/platform-node` for HTTP client
- Compatible with existing `Conversation` and `Message` types
- Follows established service/layer patterns

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Auto-Detection Feature
The most significant improvement made during implementation was removing the manual provider configuration requirement:

**Before**: Required `LLM_PROVIDERS` environment variable listing active providers
**After**: Automatic detection based on presence of API keys

### 2. Enhanced Testing Coverage
Added comprehensive multi-turn conversation tests for each provider to ensure proper context handling across all LLM APIs:
- Each provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) now has dedicated multi-turn conversation tests
- Tests verify that conversation context is maintained correctly by each provider
- Increased test timeout to 60s to accommodate API response times

### 3. Test Code Refactoring
Refactored integration tests to eliminate code duplication:
- Created data-driven test structure with provider configurations
- Implemented common test runner function (`runTest`) for consistent test execution
- Used loop-based test generation to create tests from configuration arrays
- Reduced test file from ~200 lines to ~170 lines while maintaining same coverage
- Makes it easier to add new providers or modify test patterns

### 4. Proper System Message Handling
Implemented correct system message extraction and passing:
- System messages are now extracted from conversations and passed separately to the AI packages
- Multiple system messages are combined with newlines
- Removed the `[System]` prefix workaround
- System messages are properly handled according to each LLM provider's requirements
- Verified with real API test showing system messages are correctly processed

### 5. Refactored to Effect's Match Syntax
Replaced switch statements with Effect's type-safe Match pattern:
- Refactored `getProviderFromModel` to use `Match.value` and `Match.when`
- Converted message role switching to Match pattern in `processConversation`  
- Updated provider layer creation to use Match instead of switch
- Provides better type safety and follows Effect best practices
- All tests continue to pass with the refactored code

### 6. Generic Provider Layer Creation
Extracted common provider layer creation logic:
- Created `createProviderLayer` function that handles all providers
- Introduced `createClientAndLayer` helper for consistent layer composition
- Eliminates code duplication across provider cases
- Makes adding new providers simpler - just add a new Match case
- Maintains full type safety while improving code readability

This simplifies configuration - users just need to set API keys for the providers they want to use:
```bash
# Old way (no longer needed)
LLM_PROVIDERS=openai,anthropic

# New way (automatic detection)
LLM_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
LLM_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
# Providers are automatically detected based on these keys
```

## Next Steps
- Can be used by test execution system to run conversations
- Provider configuration via environment variables (auto-detected)
- Model selection passed at runtime, not from config
